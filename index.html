			<h3>Background:</h3> 
			<p>Patients with multiple chronic conditions often struggle with behavioral health, mental health challenges, and unmet social needs. Primary care physicians are uniquely positioned to address these needs and connect patients to community resources. However, patients may face challenges to accessing these resources such as geographic distance, paperwork requirements, or costs of the resources. It is important to understand if community resources are in areas of need and the characteristics of the resources.</p>
			<h3>Objective:</h3> 
			<p>To better understand the geographic distribution of resources for health behavior, mental health, and social needs in relation to needs within the community.</p> 
			<h3>Methods:</h3> 
			<p>Community resources identified with Aunt Bertha and RVA Community Cares Complete Resource Directory. Population characteristics relating to 10 different health behaviors, mental health needs, and social needs were mapped at the Census Tract Level using ArcGIS and publicly available data. Incremental spatial autocorrelation was used to calculate the distance value in which spatial correlation was greatest for each domain. The distance value was then used for hot spot analysis. Hotspots (red areas) are areas where the clusters have significantly higher rates of the outcome of interest compared to the mean of all census tracts. Cold spots (gray areas) are areas that have lower rates of the outcome of interest than the mean of all the census tracts.</p>

			<p>Below are the maps investigating the relationship between housing insecurity and housing resources in Richmond, VA. The Eviction Rate was mapped using the Eviction Rate published by the Eviction Lab. Map 1 is a descriptive map portraying the eviction rate in each census tract of Richmond, VA. The rate was categorized by quintiles. Map 2 and 3 display the results from the hot spot cluster analysis using eviction rates to identify statistically significant clusters of eviction rates. The high need areas are the red census tracts which show clusters that are at least 1.68 Standard Deviations above the mean of eviction rate of Richmond VA census tracts. The low need areas are the blue census tracts that show clusters that are at least 1.68 Standard Deviations below the mean of eviction rate of Richmond, VA census tracts. Map 2 also displays the number of housing resources by the type of payment required. The yellow dots are resources that are free, the blue-green dots are resources that are offered at a reduced cost, the black dots are resources that cost without any reduced fees, and the gray dots are resources without any data on cost. For Map 3 the yellow dots are resources that do not require paperwork (government issued ID, Driver’s license, photo ID, social security card, social security income statement, proof of income, utility bill, eviction notice, court documents, child’s birth certificate, proof of residency, or other). The black dots are resources that do require any paperwork and gray dots are resources that have no data on paperwork requirements.</p>
