			<h3>Background:</h3> 
			<p>Patients with multiple chronic conditions often struggle with behavioral health, mental health challenges, and unmet social needs. Primary care physicians are uniquely positioned to address these needs and connect patients to community resources. However, patients may face challenges to accessing these resources such as geographic distance, paperwork requirements, or costs of the resources. It is important to understand if community resources are in areas of need and the characteristics of the resources.</p>
			<h3>Objective:</h3> 
			<p>To better understand the geographic distribution of resources for health behavior, mental health, and social needs in relation to needs within the community.</p> 
			<h3>Methods:</h3> 
			<p>Community resources identified with Aunt Bertha and RVA Community Cares Complete Resource Directory. Population characteristics relating to 10 different health behaviors, mental health needs, and social needs were mapped at the Census Tract Level using ArcGIS and publicly available data. Incremental spatial autocorrelation was used to calculate the distance value in which spatial correlation was greatest for each domain. The distance value was then used for hot spot analysis. Hotspots (red areas) are areas where the clusters have significantly higher rates of the outcome of interest compared to the mean of all census tracts. Cold spots (gray areas) are areas that have lower rates of the outcome of interest than the mean of all the census tracts.</p> 
			<h3>Data:</h3>

		<h2 id="Nutrition">Nutrition</h2>
		<p>Below are the maps investigating the relationship between obesity and nutrition resources in Richmond, VA. The prevalence of obesity was mapped using the obesity prevalence among adults older than and including 18 from the 500 Cities project. Map 1 is a descriptive map portraying obesity by census tract in Richmond, VA as well as nutrition resources. Obesity was categorized by quintiles. All nutrition resources are shown by black dots. Map 2 and 3 display the results from the hot spot analysis used to identify statistically significant clusters of obesity as well as different characteristics of nutrition resources. The high need areas (red census tracts) are the clusters that are at least 1.68 standard deviations above the mean of the obesity prevalence of Richmond, VA census tracts. The low need areas (blue census tracts) are the clusters that are at least 1.68 Standard Deviations below the mean of the obesity prevalence of Richmond, VA census tracts. Map 2 also displays nutrition resources by the type of payment required. The yellow dots are resources that are free, the blue-green dots are resources that are offered at a reduced cost, the black dots are resources that cost and do not offer any reduced fees, and the gray dots are resources without any data on cost. For Map 3 the yellow dots are resources that do not require paperwork (government issued ID, Driver’s license, photo ID, social security card, social security income statement, proof of income, utility bill, eviction notice, court documents, child’s birth certificate, proof of residency, or other). The black dots are resources that do require any paperwork of the above paperwork and gray dots are resources that have no data on paperwork requirements. </p>

The low need areas (blue census tracts) are the clusters that are at least 1.68 Standard Deviations below the mean of the eviction rate of Richmond, VA census tracts. Map 2 also displays housing resources by the type of payment required. The yellow dots are resources that are free, the blue-green dots are resources that are offered at a reduced cost, the black dots are resources that cost and do not offer any reduced fees, and the gray dots are resources without any data on cost. For Map 3 the yellow dots are resources that do not require paperwork (government issued ID, Driver’s license, photo ID, social security card, social security income statement, proof of income, utility bill, eviction notice, court documents, child’s birth certificate, proof of residency, or other). The black dots are resources that do require any paperwork of the above paperwork and gray dots are resources that have no data on paperwork requirements. </p>
